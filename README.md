# 🌾 GrainPalette - A Deep Learning Odyssey in Rice Type Classification Through Transfer Learning

GrainPalette is a deep learning-based web application that classifies rice grain images into five different types using a transfer learning approach. The project leverages MobileNetV2, a lightweight CNN architecture, to achieve high accuracy with minimal computational resources.
